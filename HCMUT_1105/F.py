# Find a minimum vertex cover
def min_vertex_cover(left_v, right_v):
    '''Use the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm to find a maximum
    matching or maximum independent set of a bipartite graph.
    Next, find a minimum vertex cover by finding the 
    complement of a maximum independent set.

    The function takes as input two dictionaries, one for the
    left vertices and one for the right vertices. Each key in 
    the left dictionary is a left vertex with a value equal to 
    a list of the right vertices that are connected to the key 
    by an edge. The right dictionary is structured similarly.

    The output is a dictionary with keys equal to the vertices
    in a minimum vertex cover and values equal to lists of the 
    vertices connected to the key by an edge.

    For example, using the following simple bipartite graph:

    1000 2000
    1001 2000

    where vertices 1000 and 1001 each have one edge and 2000 has 
    two edges, the input would be:

    left = {1000: [2000], 1001: [2000]}
    right = {2000: [1000, 1001]}

    and the ouput or minimum vertex cover would be:

    {2000: [1000, 1001]}

    with vertex 2000 being the minimum vertex cover.

    The code can also generate a bipartite graph with an arbitrary
    number of edges and vertices, write the graph to a file, and 
    read the graph and convert it to the appropriate format.'''
