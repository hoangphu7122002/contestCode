/*
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm allows to solve the second variation of the problem - finding all pairs of vertices  
$(i, j)$  which don't have a shortest path between them (i.e. a path of arbitrarily small weight exists).

Again, the details can be found in the Floyd-Warshall article, and here we describe only its application.

Run Floyd-Warshall algorithm on the graph. Initially  
$d[v][v] = 0$  for each  
$v$ . But after running the algorithm  
$d[v][v]$  will be smaller than  
$0$  if there exists a negative length path from  
$v$  to  
$v$ . We can use this to also find all pairs of vertices that don't have a shortest path between them. We iterate over all pairs of vertices  
$(i, j)$  and for each pair we check whether they have a shortest path between them. To do this try all possibilities for an intermediate vertex  
$t$ .  
$(i, j)$  doesn't have a shortest path, if one of the intermediate vertices  
$t$  has  
$d[t][t] < 0$  (i.e.  
$t$  is part of a cycle of negative weight),  
$t$  can be reached from  
$i$  and  
$j$  can be reached from  
$t$ . Then the path from  
$i$  to  
$j$  can have arbitrarily small weight. We will denote this with -INF
